## Past Cases

1. Centralized Hyperliquid CLOB Vault (Jelly-jelly attack)

Attack happend when a trader open massive short but price is skyrocketed. The loss is too big and imbalance orderbook liquidity, then HLP (hyperliquid vault) take over the trade that exposed into large risk  

**Lesson :** Oracle override, using vault as liquidity engine, centralized vault

2. Binance Oracle (ATOM, BNSOL, USDE, WBETH)

A domino effect triggered by a internal oracle, amplified by auto-liquidations and feedback loops inside Binance. A small liquidity hiccup → wrong price feed → mass liquidation → more selling → system meltdown. But, binance announce incorrect price due to display issue

**Lesson :** unstable oracle, unclear, no transparency

3. Executed Trade Without Oracle (Balancer Exploit)

Attacker crafted a transaction that skipped any price quote step and directly told the Vault to move funds, often doing the rest (swaps, consolidation, bridging) in the same transaction or immediately after.

**Lesson :** No quotation/price discovery on vault activity

## Traditional Lending Protocol Feature Issue

**The Traders POV** 

1. Borrowing Liquidation 

When traders borrow against their collateral, lending protocols force liquidate during market drops. Users watch helplessly as their collateral gets sold at crash prices, **unable to protect themselves** by strategically converting to stable assets beforehand.

2. Expensive Manual Repayment Cost

When traders borrow asset and immediately swap to other asset, they must manually repay the loan at market rates (including gas fees, slippage etc). They **miss opportunities to automatically repay at prefferable price**, then losing the chance to reduce borrowing costs during market dips.

## Our CLOB Protection Layer
To prevent incidents like the last three major DeFi cases, we should ensure:

## Our Solution

ScaleX routes idle order capital to a lending pool until fill, dynamically manages utilization to protect lenders and borrowers, and shares interest back to lenders—aligning **incentives while preserving orderbook** liquidity, while **allowing users to personalize orders** at preferred prices. 
    
Orderbook liquidity is **natural and user-driven; no internal vault manufactures orders**.
