## Lesson Learned

1. Centralized Hyperliquid CLOB Vault (Jelly-jelly attack)

Attack happend when a trader open massive short but price is skyrocketed. The loss is too big and imbalance orderbook liquidity, then HLP (hyperliquid vault) take over the trade that exposed into large risk  

**Lesson :** Oracle override, using vault as liquidity engine, centralized vault

2. Binance Oracle (ATOM, BNSOL, USDE, WBETH)

A domino effect triggered by a internal oracle, amplified by auto-liquidations and feedback loops inside Binance. A small liquidity hiccup → wrong price feed → mass liquidation → more selling → system meltdown. But, binance announce incorrect price due to display issue

**Lesson :** unstable oracle, unclear, no transparency

3. Executed Trade Without Oracle (Balancer Exploit)

Attacker crafted a transaction that skipped any price quote step and directly told the Vault to move funds, often doing the rest (swaps, consolidation, bridging) in the same transaction or immediately after.

**Lesson :** No quotation/price discovery on vault activity

Preventing these 3 last 3 major defi incident.
