# Magical Architecture

To help users understand the landscape, here’s a breakdown of the most common borrowing products — **OKX Auto Borrow**, **Auto Repay**, **Binance Post Only**, and **Bybit Dual Win** — explaining how each works and where they fall short.

---

## 🧩 OKX Auto Borrow

**Mechanism:**
Automatically borrows assets when an order exceeds the user’s available balance.

**Process:**
1. User places an order larger than their current funds.
2. System borrows the shortfall from the margin pool instantly.
3. Borrowing occurs within the same transaction; interest starts immediately.

**Purpose:**
Simplifies leveraged or margin trading by removing manual borrowing steps.

**Disadvantage:**
- Interest starts accruing immediately, even if the position isn’t filled or used.
- Requires centralized custody — user funds are locked within the platform’s margin system.
- Limited transparency over borrowing interest rates and collateral management.

## 💡 Auto Repay (OKX)

**Mechanism:**
Automatically repays borrowed funds once a position is closed or profit is realized.

**Process:**
1. After a margin or leveraged position closes, the system checks outstanding debt.
2. Any available balance or profit is used to repay the borrowed amount.
3. Remaining funds return to the user’s account.

**Purpose:**
Reduces idle debt and avoids unnecessary interest accumulation.

**Disadvantage:**
- Repayment logic is rigid; users cannot customize how much to repay.
- Can unintentionally reduce liquidity if profits are automatically locked for repayment.

## ⚙️ Binance Post Only

**Mechanism:**
Ensures that an order is added to the order book as a **maker order** only.

**Process:**
1. When placing an order, if it would execute immediately, it is cancelled.
2. This guarantees the order provides liquidity instead of taking it.

**Purpose:**
Used by traders to maintain maker status and earn fee rebates while avoiding instant execution.

**Disadvantage:**
- Rebates are only earned **after** the order executes; idle orders earn nothing.
- Orders may get cancelled frequently in fast-moving markets, leading to missed opportunities.

## ⚖️ Bybit Dual Win

**Mechanism:**
A structured product that blends **options** and **yield strategies** to offer two potential profit outcomes.

**Process:**
1. User deposits an asset and selects a target price (strike).
2. If the target is reached, funds convert to stablecoins at a premium.
3. If not, the user earns fixed yield on the deposited asset.

**Purpose:**
Allows users to earn yield in both price outcomes — ideal for passive or range-bound market conditions.

**Disadvantage:**
- Comes with a **fixed settlement price** and **expiry date**, limiting flexibility.
- Users cannot adjust or exit positions mid-term without penalty.
- Yield and conversion rates depend heavily on market volatility.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature | Mechanism | Purpose | Disadvantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto Borrow | Automatically borrows shortfall funds during order placement | Enables smooth margin trading | Interest accrues instantly; centralized custody |
| Auto Repay | Repays borrowed assets after position close | Reduces idle debt and interest costs | No user control over repayment logic |
| Post Only | Ensures orders rest as makers, not takers | Controls execution and earns maker fees | Earns rebates only after execution; idle orders generate nothing |
| Dual Win | Structured yield product with two possible outcomes | Earns yield in either direction | Fixed settlement price and expiry limit flexibility |

---
While these tools automate parts of trading, they still leave users exposed to inefficiencies like forced borrowing, missed yield, or execution friction. **ScaleX** eliminates these pain points through a unified system that optimizes liquidity, yield, and execution in one seamless process.

## 🚀 How ScaleX Solves These Limitations

| Feature | Existing Limitation | ScaleX Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Auto Repay | Fixed repayment logic; automatically uses profit or balance, reducing flexibility | **Customizable repayment amount and timing** — no forced size reduction |
| Post Only | Earns rebates only after execution; idle orders earn nothing | **Earns yield while waiting** + **rebate after fill**; orders remain active (non-cancelable) |
| Dual Win | Fixed strike price and expiry date; limited control | **User-customizable target price**, **no expiry**, adjustable anytime |
