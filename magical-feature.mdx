# Magical Architecture

To help users understand the landscape, here’s a breakdown of the most common borrowing and trading products — **OKX Auto Borrow / Repay**, **Binance Post Only**, **Bybit Dual Win**, and **Fidelity Margin Loan** — explaining how each works, their purpose, and where they fall short.

---

## 🧩 OKX Auto Borrow / Repay

**Mechanism:**
Automatically borrows assets when an order exceeds available balance, and repays when the position closes or profit is realized.

**Process:**
1. User places an order larger than their available funds.  
2. The system borrows the shortfall from the margin pool instantly.  
3. When the position closes, the borrowed amount is automatically repaid using the user’s balance or profit.

**Purpose:**
Simplifies margin trading and reduces idle debt by automating borrowing and repayment.

**Disadvantage:**
- Interest accrues immediately upon borrowing, even if orders aren’t filled.  
- Users have no control over repayment logic, leading to potential unwanted size reduction.  
- Requires centralized custody; funds must remain in the platform’s margin system.

## ⚙️ Binance Post Only

**Mechanism:**
Ensures that orders are added to the order book as **maker orders** only.

**Process:**
1. When a trader places an order that would execute immediately, the system cancels it.  
2. Guarantees the order provides liquidity and earns maker rebates.

**Purpose:**
Designed for traders seeking maker fee rebates and precise execution control.

**Disadvantage:**
- Rebates apply **only after execution**; idle orders earn no yield.  
- Orders may be canceled frequently during high volatility, reducing fill opportunities.

## ⚖️ Bybit Dual Win

**Mechanism:**
A structured product that combines **yield** and **options** to generate returns from two possible outcomes.

**Process:**
1. User deposits an asset and selects a target (strike) price.  
2. If the target is reached, the asset converts to stablecoins at a premium.  
3. If not, the user earns a fixed yield for the duration.  

**Purpose:**
Allows users to earn in either direction — ideal for range-bound markets or passive strategies.

**Disadvantage:**
- Includes a **fixed settlement price** and **expiry date**, limiting flexibility.  
- Cannot adjust or exit positions mid-term without penalty.  
- Yield depends heavily on market volatility.

## 🏦 Fidelity Margin Loan

**Mechanism:**
Traditional brokerage margin loan where users borrow against portfolio assets to increase leverage.

**Process:**
1. Users pledge eligible securities as collateral.  
2. Fidelity lends cash based on a percentage of asset value.  
3. Interest is charged daily until repayment.  

**Purpose:**
Provides liquidity for investors without selling existing holdings.

**Disadvantage:**
- Fixed interest rates that adjust slowly with market conditions.  
- No on-chain transparency or automation.  
- Limited repayment flexibility; requires manual management.

While these tools streamline certain aspects of trading and borrowing, they still leave users exposed to inefficiencies like forced borrowing, idle capital, or rigid repayment logic.  

**ScaleX** integrates these ideas into a single, yield-optimized system — merging liquidity, leverage, and automation into one composable DeFi architecture.
