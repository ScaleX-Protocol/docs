## Overview

The **Health Factor (HF)** represents the overall safety of a user's borrowing position.  
It measures how close an account is to liquidation — a higher value means a safer position.

It's a powerful way to examine risk in a specific collateral on debt, but it doesn't fit when the user has multiple collateral assets or debts.

<Info>
Health Factor like a credit score but works for onchain DeFi. Higher means further from liquidation.

## Formula

Health Factor = Risk-adjusted Collateral Value / Risk-adjusted Debt Value

Each asset has its own **risk weight**, reflecting the volatility.  
For example, stablecoins typically have higher collateral factors than volatile tokens like ETH or BTC.

<Tip>
When our Health Factor drops below **1.0**, our position becomes eligible for liquidation. So, maintaining a buffer above 1.5 helps protect collateral from sudden market swings.

| **1.5 – 2.0** | 🟡 Safe | Healthy position, golden spot |
| **1.0 – 1.5** | 🟠 Moderate | Monitor closely — nearing liquidation threshold |
