## Overview

Synthetic token are generated as long as interaction with pool. Adopting from EIP-4626, yield-bearing vault tokens representing both trading positions and lending shares.

EIP-4626, also known as ERC-4626, is a token standard designed for yield-bearing vaults. It defines a universal way to represent and manage users’ shares in a vault, making DeFi protocols more compatible with one another. 


## ERC-4626: Standardizing Yield Vaults

**ERC-4626**, formally known as *EIP-4626: Tokenized Vault Standard*, introduces a unified framework for yield-bearing vaults in decentralized finance.  
Prior to its adoption, vault implementations varied across protocols, leading to inconsistencies in accounting, integrations, and automation.  
ERC-4626 resolves these issues by defining standardized interfaces for deposit, withdrawal, minting, and redemption operations.

By standardizing core actions like deposits and withdrawals, EIP-4626 eliminates the messy, inconsistent methods that existed before — paving the way for smoother integrations and a more efficient DeFi ecosystem.

## Token Generation - Burn Mechanism

- **Represent shares:** Turn user deposits into ERC-4626 tokens that mirror ownership in a yield-bearing vault.
- **Deposit assets:** Send underlying tokens like ETH or stablecoins into the vault and mint ERC-4626 tokens in return.
- **Accrue yield:** Let the vault generate returns, increasing the value of each vault token over time.
- **Withdraw funds:** Burn vault tokens to redeem the original deposit plus the accumulated yield.


## Mathematical Representation

Let:

P = Total underlying assets in the vault  
S = Total supply of ERC-4626 shares  
E = P / S

Where E represents the **exchange rate**, or the value of one vault token in terms of the underlying asset.  
As yield accumulates, P increases while S remains constant, causing E to rise proportionally.

User yield is thus embedded in the token’s internal accounting rather than through explicit reward emissions.

## Why ERC-4626?

- **Standardization:** Simplify integrations and audits across DeFi protocols.  
- **Capital Efficiency:** All deposited assets contribute to yield generation; idle capital is minimized.  
- **Composability:** ERC-4626 tokens can be used as collateral or combined within other protocols without additional wrapping.  
- **Transparent Accounting:** Yield and ownership are mathematically verifiable through the vault’s total asset and total supply metrics.  
- **Gas Optimization:** Shared interface logic reduces the need for redundant smart-contract code across vaults.

This architecture ensures that all user positions remain fully composable, auditable, and efficient — forming a foundational layer for scalable, yield-driven DeFi systems.
