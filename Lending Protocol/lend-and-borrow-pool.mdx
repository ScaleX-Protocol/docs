## Overview

The **Lend & Borrow Pool** is a core component of our liquidity layer.  
It allows users to **lend assets** to earn passive yield or **borrow assets** to gain capital efficiency and leverage.

When users supply assets, they receive **synthetic vault tokens** that represent their share of the pool.  
These tokens automatically accrue value as interest is paid by borrowers and can be redeemed 1:1 for the underlying asset at any time.

<Info>
Supplying assets adds liquidity to the pool.  
Borrowers draw from this same liquidity, and the interest they pay continuously increases the value of each vault token.

## How It Works

1. **Supply Assets**  
   Users deposit supported assets into the lending pool.  
   In return, they receive a synthetic token (e.g., sETH, sUSDC) representing their position.

2. **Pool Utilization**  
   The pool aggregates all supplied liquidity.  
   Borrowers draw from this shared pool, creating a dynamic balance between **available supply** and **borrowed assets**.

3. **Accrued Value**  
   As borrowers pay interest, the total value of the pool increases.  
   Lenders’ synthetic tokens automatically reflect this growth — no manual claiming required.

4. **Withdraw or Redeem**  
   Lenders can withdraw their assets at any time, receiving both their principal and the interest earned.

## Utilization Rate

The **Utilization Rate (U)** measures how much of the pool’s liquidity is currently borrowed:

U = Total Borrowed / Total Supplied

It reflects the pool’s activity and directly influences the interest rate model.

- **Low Utilization:** More liquidity available → lower borrow rates.  
- **Optimal Utilization:** Supply and demand balanced → efficient capital flow.  
- **High Utilization:** Limited liquidity → higher borrow rates and lender yields.

<Tip>
High utilization means capital is efficiently deployed — but also that available liquidity for withdrawals may be temporarily limited.

## Summary

| Utilization Level | Borrower Impact | Lender Impact | Rate Behavior |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Low** | Easy to borrow | Lower yield | ↓ Interest rate |
| **Optimal** | Balanced | Balanced | ⚖ Stable |
| **High** | Harder to borrow | Higher yield | ↑ Interest rate |

**In essence:**  
The Lend & Borrow Pool connects liquidity providers and borrowers in a self-balancing system — where interest rates dynamically adjust to match real-time market activity.
