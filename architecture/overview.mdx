![Unified CLOB DEX-Lending Protocol Architecture](/images/architecture.png)

The Unified CLOB DEX-Lending Protocol integrates trading and lending through five core components that work together to maximize capital efficiency.

## Core Components

The protocol operates through five integrated components:

1. **[Balance Manager](./balance-manager)** - Maintains 1:1 peg, tracks yields, and issues synthetic tokens when users deposit assets

2. **[Synthetic Tokens](./synthetic-token)** - ERC20 tokens representing 1:1 pegged underlying assets that trade on the order book while users earn yield from underlying deposits

3. **[Order Book](./orderbook)** - High-performance CLOB with Red-Black Tree data structure for O(log n) price operations and integrated lending awareness

4. **[Oracle](./oracle)** - Multi-timeframe TWAP oracle providing manipulation-resistant pricing for trading, borrowing, and collateral valuation

5. **[Lending Manager](./lending-manager)** - Generates yield from real assets through native lending protocol with integrated order book access
