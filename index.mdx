## Why This Combo Creates the "Perfect Duo"

Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEXes match limit orders. While orders wait in the book, they do not earn yield. 
Lending protocols continuously generate interest based on utilization. When combined, idle capital can earn yield until an order is filled, and borrowing demand increases utilization, reinforcing the flywheel.

Here is the flow at a glance:
