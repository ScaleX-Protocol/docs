A trader wants to buy 1 BTC at \$60,000 - what they believe is the perfect price level. With \$60,000 capital, they face a **tough choice**:

- Place a limit order at \$60,000 and **earn zero yield** while waiting
- Supply \$60,000 to AAVE at 12% APY and **earn \$600 monthly**, but risk missing BTC at \$60,000 if it pumps

If BTC jumps to \$65,000, they **completely miss the trading opportunity**. If they choose yield farming, they might **miss the perfect entry** at \$60,000.

**Worst case: they miss both the BTC trade AND the yield - leaving their capital completely unproductive.**

Most traders end up splitting their capital, **compromising both their trading strategy and yield potential**.

The fundamental issue is: **You can't use your existing portfolio as collateral directly**. Current DeFi platforms force you to choose, your assets are either locked in limit orders OR deployed in yield protocols, never both.

The infrastructure simply doesn't allow your trading positions to work as productive collateral. Your capital sits completely dead while waiting for your trade to execute.

The truth is we're all tired of missing out on opportunities while our capital sits completely unproductive.
