A trader wants to buy 1 BTC at \$60,000 - what they believe is the perfect price level. With \$60,000 capital, they face a **tough choice**:

- Place a limit order at \$60,000 and **earn zero yield** while waiting
- Supply \$60,000 to AAVE at 12% APY and **earn \$600 monthly**, but risk missing BTC at \$60,000 if it pumps

If BTC jumps to \$65,000, they **completely miss the trading opportunity**. If they choose yield farming, they might **miss the perfect entry** at \$60,000.

**Worst case: they miss both the BTC trade AND the yield - leaving their capital completely unproductive.**

Most traders end up splitting their capital, **compromising both their trading strategy and yield potential**.

The truth is we're all tired of missing out on opportunities while our capital sits completely unproductive.
