## Why This Combo Creates the "Perfect Duo"

Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) DEXes match limit orders. While orders wait in the book, they do not earn yield. 
Lending protocols continuously generate interest based on utilization. When combined, idle capital can earn yield until an order is filled, and borrowing demand increases utilization, reinforcing the flywheel.

Here is the flow at a glance:

**Yield Opportunity Attracts Deposits**

Traders are drawn to the platform by its yield-bearing mechanism, depositing assets into the pool even before orders are filled

**Low Utilization Attracts Borrowers**

When utilization is low, borrowing is attractive, drawing in traders who want leverage and liquidity

**Borrowing Raises Utilization**

Borrow activity increases utilization of the lending pool, activating higher interest accrual

**Interest Pays Lenders**

Borrowers pay interest, which is distributed as yield to lenders whose capital powers the system

**Active Repay and Reborrow Cycle Enhances Depth**

Borrowers continuously execute repay and reborrow actions to maintain or increase positions, adding dynamic liquidity depth to the orderbook and stabilizing market flow.

So, CLOB-DEX are **perfect to continously generate yield on idle capital while order to be filled**
