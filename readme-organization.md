# 🚀 GTX (Great Trading Xperience)

## 🌎 Overview

GTX is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to enable permissionless **spot trading**, with plans to expand into perpetual markets in the future. Addressing inefficiencies in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and centralized exchanges, GTX provides an order book-based, permissionless trading experience that is **fair, efficient, and scalable**.

---

## ❌ Problems with Traditional AMMs

- **🔄 Inefficient Capital Utilization** – AMMs require deep liquidity to minimize slippage, leading to inefficient capital allocation.
- **💰 High Impermanent Loss** – Liquidity providers often suffer from impermanent loss due to volatile price movements.
- **📉 Price Manipulation** – AMMs are vulnerable to front-running and sandwich attacks, harming traders.
- **🚧 Restricted Market Listings** – Centralized exchanges limit listings, making it difficult for emerging assets to gain liquidity.

## ✅ GTX Solution for Spot Trading

GTX introduces a **Central Limit Order Book (CLOB)-based DEX** with:

1. **🌐 Decentralized Market Creation** – Anyone can list a spot trading pair without permission.
2. **📊 Efficient Order Book Trading** – CLOB enables traders to set limit orders and achieve fair price execution.
3. **🤖 AMM-Free Model** – Eliminates impermanent loss risks by relying on direct peer-to-peer trading.
4. **📡 Oracle-Free Spot Trading** – Uses an order book mechanism to ensure transparent and decentralized price discovery.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **💱 Spot Trading** – Fully decentralized CLOB-based exchange.
- **🚀 Permissionless Market Creation** – No gatekeepers—anyone can list a new market.
- **🔍 Fair and Transparent Pricing** – No reliance on external oracles for spot trades.
- **📈 Optimized Liquidity Utilization** – Capital-efficient trading mechanism compared to AMMs.
- **⚡ High-Frequency Trading Ready** – Supports traders placing orders with minimal delay.
- **🛑 No Liquidity Providers (LPs) Needed** – Orders are matched peer-to-peer, removing LP dependency.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![CLOB DEX Architecture](../diagram.png)

The CLOB DEX system consists of four main components:
- **GTXRouter**: Entry point for all user interactions
- **PoolManager**: Manages trading pairs and pool deployments
- **OrderBook**: Handles order placement and matching using RB-Tree
- **BalanceManager**: Manages token deposits, withdrawals, and locks

## 📡 Indexer Integration

We use Ponder for indexing, which allows the frontend to easily query key data such as candlestick charts, pool balances, and listed markets. Ponder is chosen due to its simple setup, customizability, and compatibility with EVM chains. It is also self-hostable, ensuring greater control over the infrastructure.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **👨‍💻 Traders** place buy/sell orders on the decentralized order book.
2. **📊 Order Matching** occurs through a fair and efficient matching engine.
3. **💰 Protocol** earns trading fees when orders are matched in the order book.
4. **🔄 Settlement** happens directly on-chain, ensuring security and transparency.
